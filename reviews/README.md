## My random ramblings
### Statistics (and data science) is both science AND art
- There is creativity and choice in creating statistical (or ML/AI) models
- Many of these choices are made by humans: 
   - which data to collect and use
   - how to clean that data
   - which variables to use
   - which thresholds to use
   - the types of models to use
   - how to present the data - the language to use, which diagrams to use, what information to highlight
   - how to interpret the data - what does it mean and how should one use it


#### The field of data science has yet to recognize, or perhaps admit, its artistic side
- I think the "art" that is involved in building models is oft ignored.  
- The education of data scientists dedicates too little time to teaching them the art of interpretation, and the ways to responsibly present and communicate the artifacts and analysis they produce to their audience
- There is a lack of recognition of this side of model-building and perhaps willfulnees to harbour the belief that machines, and the models they produce by extension, couldn't possibly be wrong.
- This lack of "self-retrospection" and honesty is a huge blindspot in the data science field


### How other fields communicate
#### Statistics
- "the art of lying with statistics" - this is a good reference

#### GIS


#### Cartography
