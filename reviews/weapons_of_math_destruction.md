# Weapons of Math Destruction (Cathy O'Neil)
- technology magnifies the reach of ML/AI systems
   - computers add efficiency and scale, making it possible churn "24/7 through petabytes of information"
- models are increasingly directly impacting humans
   - "increasingly they focused [...] on human beings [...] predicting our trustworthiness and calculating our potential as students, workers, lovers, criminals."
- models erroneously "marketed as fair and objective"
   - the undertone here is that this was erroneous and irresponsible
   - given the current events, one could even say criminally so, perpetuating systemic racism
- how does bias get introduced?
   - developing models requires choices and interpretations to be made in selecting the variables that are important and how important they are (weights)
   - these choices are made by humans and humans are fallible, despite any best intentions
      - many models encode "prejudice, misunderstanding, and bias into the software systems that increasingly managed our lives"
- many are flawed and used in the wild unchecked - there is no human in the loop to add an element of common sense and checks and bounds
