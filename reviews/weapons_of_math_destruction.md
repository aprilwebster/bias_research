# Weapons of Math Destruction (Cathy O'Neil)
- technology magnifies the reach of ML/AI systems
   - computers add efficiency and scale, making it possible churn "24/7 through petabytes of information"
- models are increasingly directly impacting humans
   - "increasingly they focused [...] on human beings [...] predicting our trustworthiness and calculating our potential as students, workers, lovers, criminals."
- models erroneously "marketed as fair and objective"
   - the undertone here is that this was erroneous and irresponsible
   - given the current events, one could even say criminally so, perpetuating systemic racism
- bias is introduced by humans
   - data is cleaned, interpreted and encoded by humans
   - model development requires human selection of variables and their importance (weights), which underlying basic ML models to use and how to configure and compose those
   - these choices are made by humans and humans are fallible, despite best intentions
      - many models encode "prejudice, misunderstanding, and bias into the software systems that increasingly managed our lives"
- models are opaque 
   - explainability in the field of ML/AI was not popular until recently, unlike other fields such as statistics and geographic information systems (AW)
   - monolithic models are the norm with very little shared with the end user in terms of what choices were made and why (AW)
- 
- many are flawed and used in the wild unchecked - there is no human in the loop to add an element of common sense and checks and bounds
